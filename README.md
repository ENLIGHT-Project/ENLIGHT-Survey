# Survey configurations for the ENLIGHT project

This repository contains the survey configurations for Jisc Online 
Surveys. The surveys were run in 2021/2022. The purpose of this repository 
is to make available the original survey forms, as well as the 
configurations.

There is no guarantee that these configurations can be reused as they 
depend on the [Jisc Online Surveys 
infrastructure](https://www.onlinesurveys.ac.uk/). The configurations are 
provided as JSON files as provided by Jisc Online Surveys, and as PDF 
exports.

JSON files were generaetd using the "Export survey" feature under 
"Design". PDFs were generaed using the "Export survey as PDF" feature 
under "Preview survey".
